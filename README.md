# Prediction with Linear Regression and Cousines
In this section, we will prediction with Linear Regression and Cousins

<hr />

1. Simple Linear Regression(LR)

  ğŸ“Œ It is to find the linear function that expresses the relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

2. Multiple Linear Regression(MLR)

  ğŸ“Œ It is to find the linear function that expresses the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

3. Principal Component Regression(PCR)

  ğŸ“Œ It is based on the idea of establishing a regression model for the resulting components after dimension reduction is applied to the variables.

4. Partial Least Squares Regression(PLS)

  ğŸ“Œ It is based on the idea of establishing a regression model by reducing the variables to a smaller number of components that do not have multicollinearity problems between them.

5. Ridge Regression

  ğŸ“Œ It is to find the sum squares error by applying the minimizing coefficients and a penalty to these coefficients.

6. Lasso Regression

  ğŸ“Œ It is to find the sum squares error by applying the minimizing coefficients and a penalty to these coefficients.

7. ElasticNet Regression

  ğŸ“Œ It is to find the sum squares error by applying the minimizing coefficients and a penalty to these coefficients. ElasticNet combines L1 and L2 approaches.
